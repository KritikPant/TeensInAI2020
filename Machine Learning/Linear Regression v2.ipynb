    "Linear regression is a commonly used regression analysis model used by many data scientists and businesses. It is a comparitively simple model allowing for quick and easy usage. As well as this, the intuition behind the model is rather simple making it the 'hello world' for artificial intelligence and machine learning models."

    "- predict sales of products based on consumer behaviour\n",

    "Linear regression is a verstaile used by many different businesses. It is under the family of models known as generalised linear models. Below is an implementation of linear regression using the python package sklearn. In a practical scenario, one is expected to use packages inlcuding sklearn, tensorflow, numpy etc. simply because of their optimisation (threading, GPU) though the fundamental processes and concepts remain the same.\n",

Feel free to use this as reference when making your own linear regression models. Below I import the necessary libraries to create the model."

If I were to give you the same test and repeat this process. Over time you would learn the answers to the questions. This seems good however if I were to give you another test on the same topic but with slighlty different questions you are not likely to score as well as you did previously. This is because you memorized the data and didn't learn. \n",

Therefore when I give you any questions on calculus you should be able to answer them correctly.\n",
