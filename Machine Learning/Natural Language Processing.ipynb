    "## Markov Chains | Text generation\n",
    "---\n",
    "Markov chains are based on the idea of dependent states. That is to say, __my current state is entirely dependent on the previous state I was in__. This idea is known as the __markov property__. Any system which can be modelled using this restraint can be modelled as a __markov chain__.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __markov chain__ is a collection of states and probabilities of moving from one state to another. A very basic example of a markov chain could be the weather. The weather can either be raining or not. In this case there are two states. Now that we have established the states, we can assign transfer probabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Assuming that the weather is raining we have a 10% chance of moving to a non-raining state and a 90% chance of continuing to rain. \n",
    "- Assuming that the weather is not raining we have a 40% chance of moving to a raining state and a 60% chance of continuing to not rain\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok so 'How does this relate to text __generation__?' you may ask. Since we have probabilities and states, we can start in any given state and walk along a path for n words or however long we want to until we reach a stop condition. Let's build a basic model of a markov chain using some probabilities for weather and build a simple weather forecaster.\n",

    "### Weather forecasting | Basic example\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below I define weather as being in one of three states: [sunny, raining, cloudy]. Each state has a likelihood of trainsferring from one state to the next. This information is represented as 2D array, known as a transfer matrix. The first line represents __transfers from__ a sunny state, the second represents a raining state, the last represents a cloudy state. Going from left to right we are representing a __transfer to__ the sunny, raining and cloudy states accordingly. For example there is a 20% chance of going from a sunny to a cloudy state. i.e. row 0, col 2 or data[0][2]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The walking algorithm is reasonably simple. We use our current state (by default the sunny state) and generate a random number which is used to pick the next state. The __random.choices() function allows us to do choose random items in a array given weights__. Syntax is random.choices(array_to_choose_from, weights = array_of_weights, k = number_of_items_picked)[0]. Note that this returns a tuple since k will repeat this process (without affecting probabilities), therefore the subscript[0] is added to unpack the tuple to an integer.\n"

      "tv future in the hands of viewers with home theatre systems  plasma high-definition tvs  and digital video recorders moving into the living room  the way people watch tv will be radically different in five years  time.  that is according to an expert panel which gathered at the annual consumer electronics show in las vegas to discuss how these new technologies will impact one of our favourite pastimes. with the us leading the trend  programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks  through cable  satellite  telecoms companies  and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices.  one of the most talked-about technologies of ces has been digital and personal video recorders (dvr and pvr). these set-top boxes  like the us s tivo and the uk s sky+ system  allow people to record  store  play  pause and forward wind tv programmes when they want.  essentially  the technology allows for much more personalised tv. they are also being built-in to high-definition tv sets  which are big business in japan and the us  but slower to take off in europe because of the lack of high-definition programming. not only can people forward wind through adverts  they can also forget about abiding by network and channel schedules  putting together their own a-la-carte entertainment. but some us networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as  brand identity  and viewer loyalty to channels. although the us leads in this technology at the moment  it is also a concern that is being raised in europe  particularly with the growing uptake of services like sky+.  what happens here today  we will see in nine months to a years  time in the uk   adam hume  the bbc broadcast s futurologist told the bbc news website. for the likes of the bbc  there are no issues of lost advertising revenue yet. it is a more pressing issue at the moment for commercial uk broadcasters  but brand loyalty is important for everyone.  we will be talking more about content brands rather than network brands   said tim hanlon  from brand communications firm starcom mediavest.  the reality is that with broadband connections  anybody can be the producer of content.  he added:  the challenge now is that it is hard to promote a programme with so much choice.   what this means  said stacey jolna  senior vice president of tv guide tv group  is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for tv viewers. it means that networks  in us terms  or channels could take a leaf out of google s book and be the search engine of the future  instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch. this kind of channel model might work for the younger ipod generation which is used to taking control of their gadgets and what they play on them. but it might not suit everyone  the panel recognised. older generations are more comfortable with familiar schedules and channel brands because they know what they are getting. they perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands  mr hanlon suggested.  on the other end  you have the kids just out of diapers who are pushing buttons already - everything is possible and available to them   said mr hanlon.  ultimately  the consumer will tell the market they want.   of the 50 000 new gadgets and technologies being showcased at ces  many of them are about enhancing the tv-watching experience. high-definition tv sets are everywhere and many new models of lcd (liquid crystal display) tvs have been launched with dvr capability built into them  instead of being external boxes. one such example launched at the show is humax s 26-inch lcd tv with an 80-hour tivo dvr and dvd recorder. one of the us s biggest satellite tv companies  directtv  has even launched its own branded dvr at the show with 100-hours of recording capability  instant replay  and a search function. the set can pause and rewind tv for up to 90 hours. and microsoft chief bill gates announced in his pre-show keynote speech a partnership with tivo  called tivotogo  which means people can play recorded programmes on windows pcs and mobile devices. all these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want  when they want.\n",
