    "Above we have the diagram of a neuron. A neuron's job is to process and transmit information (in the form of electricity) from one neuron to the next. I does this biologically through two main components, the dendrites and the axon. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dendrites on the left recieve incoming signals and the axons help send out signals, based on the dendrite. i.e. if the dendrite has a strong signal incoming, then the axon is likely to also send out a strong signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neurons are linked up into networks, therefore one neuron's output leads to another neuron's input creating a chain of firing messages. Through firing messages, certain messages can become stronger and others weaker. If we reward and punish the network's outputs, over time the network will begin to learn recognise certain patterns and adjust how strong certain messages become. By doing so it starts to train itself to perform certain tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Biologically a neuron is a lot more complex however we abstract the concept of a neuron for AI. As far as we are concerned, neurons (aka nodes) have inputs and outputs and can weight certain inputs / outputs in order to achieve tasks. In AI we represent the electrical signals as numbers to simplify the process.\n",

    "#### Neural Network | Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The neural networks that we will be coding are known as fully connected networks, I shall explain why. Networks are comprised of layers of neurons. Input is fed into the input layer of the network, then each layer successively fires after the next until we reach the final 'output layer'. (Layer that are not output nor input layers are known as 'hidden layers') At this layer we can recieve an answer from our neural network. Each layer can consist of any number of neurons. Between each layer there exists connections (which act as the dendrites and axons for our network), these connections pass messages forward from each layer and can weight certain connections between neurons (in order to allow certain messages to have more impact). For each layer in our network, each neuron will have one connection to each neuron in the next layer, hence the term fully connected network.\n",

    "#### Neuron | Input data\n",
    "\n",
    "In a neural network each node is associated with some inputs (numbers). The way a node recieves information is through a connection which inturn has a weight. The stronger the weight of a connection, the more impact that input will have on the node. \n",

    "\n",
    "- size of their current mattress\n",
    "- how old their current mattress is \n",
    "    \n",
    "Whilst the size of their mattress may have some effect, I think we can agree that the age of a mattress is much more important when figuring out how likely people are towards buying a new mattress. As a result the size input should have less effect than the age input. We can control this through weights. Therefore the connection between the size input and the network have a much smaller weight than the connection between the age input and the network.\n",

    "<blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing with the example of a consumer's probability to buy a mattress, if we were to use a neuron without an activation function, this neuron would fail to predict the probability as the neuron may start to return values that exceed the range of 0 - 1. As well as this the neuron would only be capable of representing some linear combination of the inputs, this may not be helpful since certain inputs may become less important over time and not follow a linear scale of importance. Now let's try this example with a neuron, that uses an activation function. To do this I will define an activation function below.\n",

    "This function (known as the sigmoid function) will squeeze a value between 0 and 1, therefore giving us output that makes sense. Since this function is not a linear function, our network will now be able to predict non-linear relations which can open up a whole new world of problems, that our network can solve. This network will now be able to return some sensible output to the user. \n",

This output will be passed through each of the neurons connections (that point to the next layer). The node highlighted in purple has all of its fowards connections highlighted in red. As the outputs of this neuron are passed on the connected neurons, the process repeats until the final layer is reached.\n",

    "It is common to see a special type of activation on the last layer of a neural network. The last layer is changed according to whatever problem we are trying to solve with the newtork. For example a if we had created a network to classify hand-drawn numbers then we might want one output for final layer. We could then create an activation function that returns a the node with the highest input. Our network could predict the following possibilities:\n",
